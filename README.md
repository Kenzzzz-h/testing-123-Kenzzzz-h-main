# Testing 123 (VS Code)

## Description

A brief introduction to VS Code and the process of accepting and submitting VS Code assignments through GitHub Classroom.

## Procedure

_The first time you accept a VS Code assignment through GitHub Classroom, you will be prompted to link your GitHub account to your name._

1. Accept the assignment using the link above and clone the repository in VS Code.
2. Follow along with the instructor's tour of the VS Code editor, including:
   1. Using the installed extensions.
   2. Previewing your code in the browser.
   3. Staging, committing, and syncing changes from the **Source Control** panel.
3. Follow along with the instructor's tour of the GitHub repository for this assignment, including:
   1. Publishing to GitHub Pages.
   2. Reviewing the autograding results.

## Submission

_It is recommended that you Stage and Commit after each major change (steps 1-3) and Sync often (step 4), even before you are finished._

1. Open the **Source Control** panel in VS Code.
2. Stage all changes by clicking the **+** next to **Changes**.
3. Enter a commit message and click the **Commit** button (use "autograde" if you want to run the autograding process and "finished" for your final commit).
4. The **Commit** button should change to a **Sync Changes** button. Click this to finish syncing the latest changes to your online GitHub repository.
5. Find your repository on GitHub.
6. Go to the **Settings** tab within the repository and navigate to the **Pages** section.
7. Under **Branch**, select the appropriate branch to publish (main) and click **Save**.
8. After a few moments, if you refresh the page, there should now be a URL near the top next to a **Visit Site** button. If you click this button, you should see your site open in a new window.
9. Copy the URL generated by GitHub Pages, paste it in the Website URL field of the corresponding Canvas assignment, and click **Submit Assignment**.

_**In-Class Coding** submissions that demonstrate a clear effort towards all of the assignment objectives will receive full credit._
